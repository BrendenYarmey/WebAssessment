          There are a total of 3789 snake species and they all live to be
          between 5 to 30 years old, depending on the species and enviornment.

          Another interesting fact is that the largest known snake gathering in
          the world is actually right here in Manitoba and invloves thousands of
          garter snakes in the spring.
